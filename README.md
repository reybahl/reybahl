## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Reyansh, a student at Yale University studying computer science and data science. I'm a machine learning researcher and software developer. My interests include natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, remote sensing, signal processing, deep learning, web development, and app development.

## **Machine Learning Projects**
* [Assistant](https://github.com/reybahl/Assistant): A machine learning powered, voice-based virtual assistant for Raspberry Pi. Supports several features like conversation, weather, opening websites, geolocation, date/time, and creating timers.
* [SOC Mapper and Predictor](https://github.com/reybahl/SOCPrediction): Using machine learning to analyze remote sensing imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 satellite to monitor and predict soil organic carbon and help facilitate regenerative agriculture, improve soil carbon sequestration, and fight climate change.
* [SciQALM](https://github.com/reybahl/SciQALM): Science Question Answering Language Model -- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Zephyr 7B Î² model, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for scientific question answering based on arXiv papers
* [RSS time-series classification](https://github.com/reybahl/Movement-Prediction-Time-Series): Using machine learning to classify time series of radio signal strength (RSS) between nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This is used to predict the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments and has applications in ambient assisted living.
* [Argumentative Element Identification](https://github.com/reybahl/Argumentative-Element-Identification): Using token classification to determine distinct argumentative elements, including claim, evidence, etc. Used Longformer (Long-Document Transformer) model for token classification.
* [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/reymaster/code): I'm ranked an expert on Kaggle and have published 18+ notebooks detailing my approaches to various real-world problems using machine learning.

## **Other Projects/Repositories**
* [Chess](https://github.com/reybahl/Chess-Game): Developed in my AP Computer Science class, this was a full chess game with a GUI implemented in Java. A demo video is linked in the repository.
* [NoteTaker](https://github.com/reybahl/NoteTaker): Full-stack note taking web application (MEAN stack)
* [Key Club Website](https://glhs-keyclub.web.app/): Website for Green Level High School Key Club. Website Link: https://glhs-keyclub.web.app/
* [Machine Learning Club Website](https://glhs-aiclub.web.app/): Website for Green Level High School AI and Machine Learning Club. Website Link: https://glhs-aiclub.web.app/
* [Green Level High AI and Machine Learning Club](https://github.com/GLHS-AI-Machine-Learning): Founded and was the president of the club for 3 years; led several projects, created lessons, and developed the website.
