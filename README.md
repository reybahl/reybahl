## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Reyansh, a freshman at Yale University planning to study computer science, statistics, and data science.

## **Machine Learning Projects**
* [Assistant](https://github.com/reybahl/Assistant): A machine learning powered, voice-based virtual assistant for Raspberry Pi. Supports several features like conversation, weather, opening websites, geolocation, date/time, and creating timers.
* [SOC Mapper and Predictor](https://github.com/reybahl/SOCPrediction): Using machine learning to analyze remote sensing imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 satellite to monitor and predict soil organic carbon and help facilitate regenerative agriculture, improve soil carbon sequestration, and fight climate change.
* [RSS time-series classification](https://github.com/reybahl/Movement-Prediction-Time-Series): Using machine learning to classify time series of radio signal strength (RSS) between nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This is used to predict the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments and has applications in ambient assisted living.
* [Argumentative Element Identification](https://github.com/reybahl/Argumentative-Element-Identification): Using token classification to determine distinct argumentative elements, including claim, evidence, etc. Used Longformer (Long-Document Transformer) model for token classification.
* [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/reymaster/code): I'm ranked an expert on Kaggle and have published 18+ notebooks detailing my approaches to various real-world problems using machine learning.

## **Other Projects/Repositories**
* [Algorithmic Programming](https://github.com/reybahl/Algorithmic-Programming): This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from multiple sources including the USA Computing Olympiad, Codeforces, and CSES.
* [Chess](https://github.com/reybahl/Algorithmic-Programming): Developed in my AP Computer Science class, this was a full chess game with a GUI implemented in Java. A demo video is linked in the repository.
* [Green Level High AI and Machine Learning Club](https://github.com/GLHS-AI-Machine-Learning): Founded and was the president of the club for 3 years; led several projects, created lessons, and developed the website.
